# Add or Delete a Profile Organization Affiliation

Organizations are shared accounts where open source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Identity Management lets you:

* Affiliate a profile with one or more organizations and for a specific enrollment period—this means that Dev Analytics counts the affiliated profile data in various organization charts and graphs.
* Delete an organization affiliation—this means that Dev Analytics does not count the affiliated profile data in organization charts and graphs.

**Do these steps:**

1. Select a **project name** of interest.
2. Select **Identity Management**.
3. Select **Profiles** from the menu ![](../.gitbook/assets/7409295.png) or [find the identity that you want](find-a-profile-or-organization.md).
4. Click a **row** that corresponds to a name of interest. Profile Information appears.
5. Go to **Affiliations**. Organizations and their corresponding enrollment dates are listed.
6. Continue to add or delete organization affiliations:
   * [Add an Organization Affiliation](add-or-delete-a-profile-organization-affiliation.md#add-an-organization-affiliation)
   * [Delete an Organization Affiliation](add-or-delete-a-profile-organization-affiliation.md#delete-an-organization-affiliation)
