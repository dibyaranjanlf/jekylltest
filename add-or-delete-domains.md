# Add or Delete Domains

You can add or delete domains to and from an organizationâ€”this means that Dev Analytics includes or excludes the domain data in organization charts and graphs, respectively. A domain can be a top-level domain such as [`adobe.com`](http://adobe.com).

**Do these steps:**

1. Select a **project name** of interest.
2. Select **Identity Management**.
3. Select **Organizations** from the top menu ![](../.gitbook/assets/7409280.png). The Organizations page appears.
4. In the Search Organizations field, enter the organization **name** to which you want to add a domain. Matching names appear.
5. Find the organization to which you want to add a domain and click the **row**. Organization information appears. Organization Details shows the organization name.
6. Go to **Domains**. The domains are listed.
7. Continue to add or delete domains:
   * [Add a Domain](add-or-delete-domains.md#add-a-domain)
   * [Delete a Domain](add-or-delete-domains.md#delete-a-domain)

### Delete a Domain
