Dev Analytics aggregates data and creates comprehensive dashboards from specific data sources. Dashboards include relevant visualizations that display analytic metrics and important data points. Drop-down lists that correspond to each data source let you select and open a dashboard:Click here to expand....

[Community](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/community/)

[Documentation](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/documentation/)

[Project Management](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/project-management/)

[Technical Management](../view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/technical-management/)

A drop-down list is only available when a related data source is available. This example shows that the Code, Documentation, Community, and Project Management data sources are available whereas the Technical Management and Distribution data sources are not: ![](../.gitbook/assets/7408021.png)
