# Pick a Time Range

You can pick a time range to apply to all the data in an overview or dashboard. By default, the time range value is set to the Last 5 Years.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Open a project dashboard and click **Time Range**. The Time Range picker opens. ![](../.gitbook/assets/timerangepicker.png)
2. Select a quick filter to apply a time range and a value: 
   * **Quick** shows preset time range values.
   * **Relative** lets you enter the relative start time. You can specify the relative start time as any number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years ago.
   * **Absolute** lets you enter the start date in the From field and the end date in the To field.

The data refreshes to match your time range selection, and the value you selected shows next to Time Range. The following example shows that the current value is Last 60 Days:
